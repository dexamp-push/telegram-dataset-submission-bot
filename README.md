Telegram Dataset Submission BotThis bot is designed to receive data submissions via Telegram and automatically log them into a specified Google Sheet. It provides a simple and convenient way to collect structured data from users directly through a messaging interface.FeaturesReceive data submissions from authorized Telegram users.Parse submitted data based on predefined formats or prompts.Append received data to a designated Google Sheet row.Provide confirmation messages to users upon successful submission.(Optional) Basic validation of submitted data.PrerequisitesBefore running the bot, ensure you have the following:A Telegram Bot Token (obtainable from BotFather on Telegram).A Google Cloud Platform project with the Google Sheets API enabled.Service account credentials (JSON file) for accessing the Google Sheet.The ID of the Google Sheet you want to write data to.Python 3.6 or higher installed.SetupClone the repository:git clone <repository_url>
cd telegram-dataset-submission-bot
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
(You will need libraries like python-telegram-bot and gspread or similar Google Sheets API wrappers. Make sure these are included in your requirements.txt).Configure Google Sheets API Access:Follow the instructions to enable the Google Sheets API for your Google Cloud project and create a service account: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/createDownload the service account key as a JSON file.Share your target Google Sheet with the email address of your service account (it will look something like your-service-account-name@your-gcp-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com).Set up Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the root directory of the project or set environment variables directly in your system.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_PATH=path/to/your/service_account_key.json
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID
# Add any other necessary configuration variables here, e.g., authorized user IDs
AUTHORIZED_USER_IDS=user_id_1,user_id_2
Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and sheet ID. The AUTHORIZED_USER_IDS should be a comma-separated list of Telegram user IDs who are allowed to use the bot for submission.ConfigurationBot Logic: The core logic for receiving and processing messages, as well as interacting with the Google Sheet, will be in the main bot script (e.g., bot.py). You will need to define how the bot expects data to be submitted (e.g., specific commands, a sequence of messages, a specific format).Google Sheet Structure: Ensure your Google Sheet has the necessary columns to match the data you intend to collect. The bot script will need to know which columns to write the received data to.Running the Botpython your_bot_script_name.py
(Replace your_bot_script_name.py with the actual name of your main bot file).The bot should now be running and listening for messages on Telegram.UsageInstruct your authorized users on how to submit data using the bot. This will depend on the specific message handling logic you've implemented. For example:Start a chat with the bot.Use a specific command like /submit.Follow the prompts provided by the bot to enter the required data fields.ContributingIf you'd like to contribute to this project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.
